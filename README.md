## Favorite Movies List

This was a web application that I created for my web application course. It has a homepage, two pages that show the list of my top ten favorite movies. Each page has 5 movies so that one page does not get too crowded. Then I have a form that allows users to give their input and let me know what I can improve on or what their favorite movies are. I also have back buttons for each page so that the user can get back to the homepage easily. Then I have a panel that when clicked gives addition information about myself and why I like movies so much. The purpose of this assignment is to create a web application that contains a list of favorites, I chose movies.
